# Poultry Farm Management System - Introduction

Here is a brief introduction about my project. I plan to develop a system for a chicken farm owned by an old friend. He sells eggs and chicks, with a flock of 60-70 chickens. Each day, he collects 40-45 eggs to sell to select sellers. In the business of selling chicks, he utilizes an incubator to maintain the eggs until they hatch, providing a controlled environment for them. He must provide various types of food for the different stages of the life of chickens. Additionally, he must meet their nutritional needs for growth and egg production, which includes supplements like vitamins and minerals. He also administers vaccinations to prevent diseases and treatments for illnesses. He is currently managing his farm operations, including record-keeping and inventory management, manually.
